            <h1>Website Tutorial</h1>
            <p>Hey Sugarbuns! This will be a website project of mine as practice! But ofc that's enough of that. Let's
                get onto the real things shall we?</p>
            <p>In this page, it will be short(long) and simple.</p>
            <p>For all devices, your hunter and survivor page navbar will be on the top! <br>
                ALSO!!! For mobile, sorry the page navbar wont be working bc I need JS to get that working :')), haven't
                learned that yet and
                most likely won't until the professor taught me. I've had enough of learning all these CSS in my free
                time xS</p>
            <p>For Ipad/PC devices. If your device is wide enough. You'll have an extra navbar that will be at the side!
            </p>
            <p>Right hand side will be a mini popular uploads section. Mostly for Guides/Tierlist/Account Migration and
                Account Recovery.</p>

            <h1>A Little Intro</h1>
            <p>Hey Sugarbuns! Now you've made it this far. In this page there is only a home page, hunter and survivors
                page alongside with a "Channel's page/About Page".
                All and all, that should be more than enough for this website! Hopefully we can add music in here too
                soon with Javascript. Just like the Official Identity V Website.
            </p>
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>For those of you who know me. I go by Yuu. Channel name is Kuroshiro Gaming, some call me Kuro, some call
                me Shiro. Some others also call me sh*t xD. It's really up to you to decide!</p>
            <p>I have been playing Identity V since July/August of 2020. I actually knew this game when it came out
                first. Never touched it because of network issues at the time (5 years ago).
                <br>
                Now as you can see I am a slowly built up a community of my own. Most of you know me for my Tierlist and
                Galatea Guides. But ofc! I still hold myself proud as a mediocre player in NA/EU.
            </p>
